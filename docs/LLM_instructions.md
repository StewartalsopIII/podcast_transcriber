# LLM Instructions

1. **Adherence to the Plan**:
   * Follow the project overview.md file and each plan.md for each feature documents step-by-step without deviating.
   * Focus on completing tasks in small, incremental steps.
   * Validate the completion of each task before proceeding.

2. **Behavioral Guidelines**:
   * Avoid unnecessary changes to existing code unless instructed.
   * Make additive changes only; do not improve what isn't broken.
   * Do not modify dependency versions unless explicitly directed.

3. **Incremental Problem-Solving**:
   * Break large tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
   * Always aim for reversible actions (e.g., create backups, avoid destructive edits).

4. **Best Practices for Code**:
   * Do not add caches, retry loops, or small delays unnecessarily.
   * Avoid monkey-patching or other risky programming practices.

5. **Error Handling**:
   * Assume that issues are likely user-related, not system-related (e.g., dependencies or libraries).
   * Handle errors gracefully and escalate to the user when stuck.

6. **General Philosophy**:
   * Treat existing working code as sacred.
   * Isolate and document new features clearly.
   * Write verbose, detailed Git commit messages to ensure all changes are traceable
